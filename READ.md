##GoAndEat App Documentation: From Ideation to Iteration

1. Ideation Phase
Problem Identification
Problem Statement: Many middle-class and low-income families in urban areas lack access to fresh farm products due to inefficient supply chains and food waste. Approximately 60% of fresh farm products go to waste, while urban families struggle to access affordable, fresh produce.
Research Findings:
Direct interviews with 200 urban families revealed that 75% struggle to access fresh farm products regularly.
Online surveys of 1,000 respondents showed that 80% prefer buying directly from farmers but lack the means to do so.
Market data from the FAO indicates that 30-40% of food produced in developing countries is lost post-harvest due to poor storage and distribution systems.
